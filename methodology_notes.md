# Methodology Notes
**Monetary Entropy and Economic Coordination: An Impossibility Theorem**

## Technical Implementation Details

This document provides detailed technical notes on the implementation of the theoretical framework and empirical analysis presented in the paper.

## Theoretical Framework Implementation

### Monetary Entropy Calculation

The core entropy measure follows the theoretical derivation in Section 3.3 of the paper:

```
E = H(Θ|M) = 0.5 * log(1 + σ²/σ₀²)
```

Where:
- `σ²` is the conditional variance of monetary signals
- `σ₀²` is the baseline variance for normalization
- The 0.5 factor derives from the Gaussian entropy formula

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Baseline Variance Calculation:**
   ```r
   baseline_var <- var(volatility[1:min(252, length(volatility))], na.rm = TRUE)
   ```
   - Uses first year of data (252 trading days) when available
   - Falls back to full sample variance for shorter series
   - Ensures positive baseline for log calculation

2. **Volatility Estimation:**
   - Primary method: GARCH(1,1) conditional volatility
   - Fallback method: 20-day rolling window standard deviation
   - Handles non-convergence automatically

3. **Entropy Bounds Validation:**
   - Theoretical minimum: 0 (perfect information)
   - Theoretical maximum: 0.5 * log(2πe) ≈ 1.42 (maximum entropy Gaussian)
   - Implementation includes bound checking and warnings

### Monetary Entropy Index (MEI) Construction

The MEI aggregates entropy across multiple financial markets using theoretically-motivated weights:

```
MEI_t = Σ w_j × E_j,t
```

Where:
- `w_j` are market-specific weights
- `E_j,t` is entropy for market j at time t

#### Market Weights (Theoretical Basis):

| Market | Weight | Information Content |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Equity | 35% | Corporate information, growth expectations |
| Bonds | 25% | Monetary policy, sovereign risk |
| Credit | 25% | Systemic risk, financial stability |
| FX | 15% | International trade, capital flows |

#### Implementation Notes:

1. **Weight Derivation:** Based on information theory literature and empirical studies of price discovery
2. **Normalization:** Each market entropy normalized by its own baseline before weighting
3. **Missing Data:** MEI calculated using available markets with weight re-normalization

## Empirical Strategy

### Natural Experiment Design

#### Experiment 1: Euro Introduction (January 1, 1999)

**Identification Strategy:** Difference-in-differences exploiting the exogenous adoption of common currency

**Treatment:** 12 Eurozone countries
**Control:** UK, Sweden, Denmark (EU members that retained national currencies)
**Period:** 1995-2010

**Empirical Specification:**
```
Dispersion_ct = α + β(PostEuro_t × EMU_c) + γX_ct + δ_c + λ_t + ε_ct
```

Where:
- `Dispersion_ct` = Interest rate dispersion or entropy measure
- `PostEuro_t` = 1 for dates ≥ January 1, 1999
- `EMU_c` = 1 for Eurozone member countries
- `X_ct` = Control variables (GDP growth, inflation, debt/GDP, current account)
- `δ_c` = Country fixed effects
- `λ_t` = Time fixed effects

**Key Assumptions:**
1. **Parallel Trends:** Without Euro adoption, treatment and control countries would have similar entropy evolution
2. **SUTVA:** No spillover effects between treatment and control countries
3. **Exogeneity:** Euro adoption timing determined by political/institutional factors unrelated to short-term entropy fluctuations

#### Experiment 2: Flash Crash (May 6, 2010)

**Identification Strategy:** Interrupted time series design exploiting algorithmic malfunction

**Treatment Period:** 2:42-3:07 PM Eastern Time
**Sample:** S&P 500 minute-level data
**Window:** Full trading day (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM)

**Empirical Specification:**
```
WelfareLoss_t = α + β(CrashPeriod_t) + γ(Entropy_t) + δ(Controls_t) + ε_t
```

**Key Variables:**
- `WelfareLoss_t` = |Price_t - VWAP_t| / VWAP_t
- `CrashPeriod_t` = 1 during 2:42-3:07 PM
- `Entropy_t` = Rolling 15-minute entropy measure
- `Controls_t` = Volume, bid-ask spread, market conditions

**Identification Assumptions:**
1. **Exogeneity:** Algorithmic malfunction unrelated to fundamental information
2. **No Anticipation:** Market participants could not anticipate the crash
3. **Immediate Effects:** Entropy effects manifest within measurement window

### Statistical Methods

#### GARCH Volatility Modeling

**Specification:** GARCH(1,1) with normal distribution
```
r_t = μ + ε_t
ε_t = σ_t × z_t, where z_t ~ N(0,1)
σ²_t = ω + α×ε²_{t-1} + β×σ²_{t-1}
```

**Estimation Details:**
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Solver: Hybrid (nlminb + solnp fallback)
- Convergence criteria: Standard rugarch package defaults
- Fallback: Rolling window volatility if GARCH fails

#### Robust Standard Errors

**Implementation:** 
- Clustered standard errors by country (Euro experiment)
- HAC (Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent) standard errors for time series
- Bootstrap standard errors for entropy measures (1000 replications)

#### Placebo Testing

**Procedure:**
1. Generate 1000 random treatment dates
2. Apply same empirical specification to each placebo date
3. Calculate treatment effects and significance levels
4. Compare true treatment effect to placebo distribution

**Validation Criteria:**
- False positive rate should be ≈ 5% at 5% significance level
- True treatment effect should be in extreme tail of placebo distribution

## Data Construction

### Price Data Processing

#### Step 1: Data Cleaning
```r
# Remove obvious outliers
data <- data %>%
  filter(abs(scale(returns)[,1]) < 5 | is.na(returns))

# Handle missing values
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    returns = ifelse(is.na(returns), log(close/lag(close)), returns)
  )
```

#### Step 2: Return Calculation
```r
# Log returns for price continuity
returns = log(close_t / close_{t-1})

# Overnight returns (if needed)
overnight_returns = log(open_t / close_{t-1})
```

#### Step 3: Volatility Estimation
```r
# Rolling window volatility (fallback method)
volatility = sqrt(rollapply(returns^2, width = 20, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE))

# GARCH conditional volatility (preferred method)
garch_fit <- ugarchfit(spec, returns)
volatility = sigma(garch_fit)
```

### Cross-Market Data Alignment

#### Time Zone Standardization
- All timestamps converted to UTC
- Market-specific trading hours respected
- Holiday calendars implemented for each market

#### Data Frequency Harmonization
- Higher frequency data aggregated to common frequency
- Forward-fill for missing observations (max 3 periods)
- Linear interpolation for short gaps

### Welfare Loss Measurement

#### Theoretical Approach
Based on the Monetary Impossibility Theorem:
```
ΔW ≥ κ × E²
```

Where `κ` is estimated from the data using:
```r
welfare_model <- lm(welfare_loss ~ I(entropy^2) - 1)
kappa <- coef(welfare_model)[1]
```

#### Empirical Proxies

1. **Price Deviation Method:**
   ```
   WelfareLoss = |Price - EfficientPrice| / EfficientPrice
   ```
   Where EfficientPrice is VWAP over longer window

2. **Bid-Ask Spread Method:**
   ```
   WelfareLoss = (Ask - Bid) / Midpoint
   ```

3. **Volume-Weighted Method:**
   ```
   WelfareLoss = Σ(Volume_i × |Price_i - VWAP|) / TotalVolume
   ```

## Robustness Testing

### Alternative Entropy Specifications

#### Shannon Entropy
For discrete probability distributions:
```
H(X) = -Σ p_i × log(p_i)
```

Implementation: Convert continuous volatility to discrete bins

#### Rényi Entropy (α = 2)
```
H_α(X) = (1/(1-α)) × log(Σ p_i^α)
```

#### Tsallis Entropy (q = 2)
```
S_q(X) = (Σ p_i^q - 1) / (q - 1)
```

### Sample Sensitivity Tests

#### Rolling Window Analysis
- Estimate main model using 3-year rolling windows
- Test stability of coefficients over time
- Identify potential structural breaks

#### Subsample Analysis
- Split sample by time periods
- Split sample by market conditions (high/low volatility)
- Bootstrap subsampling (1000 iterations)

#### Frequency Robustness
- Daily vs. weekly vs. monthly data
- Intraday analysis for flash crash experiment
- Long-run vs. short-run effects

## Computational Implementation

### Performance Optimization

#### Data Handling
```r
# Use data.table for large datasets
library(data.table)
setDT(data)

# Efficient rolling calculations
data[, volatility := frollapply(returns, 20, sd, na.rm = TRUE)]
```

#### Parallel Processing
```r
# GARCH estimation in parallel
library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1)
garch_results <- parLapply(cl, data_list, estimate_garch)
stopCluster(cl)
```

#### Memory Management
```r
# Clear intermediate objects
rm(large_object)
gc()

# Use appropriate data types
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)  # Not POSIXct if time not needed
```

### Numerical Stability

#### Entropy Calculation
```r
# Avoid log(0) issues
entropy <- ifelse(variance > 1e-10, 
                 0.5 * log(1 + variance), 
                 0)
```

#### GARCH Convergence
```r
# Multiple solver attempts
solvers <- c("hybrid", "solnp", "nlminb")
for(solver in solvers) {
  fit <- try(ugarchfit(spec, data, solver = solver))
  if(class(fit) != "try-error" && convergence(fit) == 0) break
}
```

### Reproducibility Measures

#### Random Seed Management
```r
set.seed(12345)  # Fixed seed for all random operations
RNGkind("Mersenne-Twister")  # Explicit RNG specification
```

#### Version Control
- Package versions recorded in session info
- R version compatibility tested (≥ 4.0.0)
- OS-specific considerations documented

#### Output Standardization
- All numerical output rounded to 6 decimal places
- LaTeX tables use consistent formatting
- Figures use publication-ready themes and fonts

## Validation Procedures

### Theoretical Consistency

#### Entropy Bounds
```r
# Check theoretical bounds
stopifnot(all(entropy >= 0, na.rm = TRUE))
stopifnot(all(entropy <= 1.5, na.rm = TRUE))  # Generous upper bound
```

#### Relationship Validation
```r
# Entropy should increase with volatility
cor_test <- cor.test(volatility, entropy)
stopifnot(cor_test$estimate > 0.8)
```

### Statistical Validation

#### Residual Diagnostics
- Ljung-Box test for serial correlation
- Jarque-Bera test for normality
- White test for heteroskedasticity
- CUSUM test for parameter stability

#### Model Selection
- AIC/BIC for GARCH specification
- Cross-validation for window length selection
- Information criteria for entropy specification

### Economic Validation

#### Magnitude Checks
- Welfare effects should be economically meaningful
- Entropy changes should align with known events
- Cross-country patterns should match institutional differences

#### Event Studies
- Major financial events should increase entropy
- Policy announcements should affect entropy predictably
- Market structure changes should have persistent effects

## Extensions and Future Research

### Potential Improvements

1. **Higher Frequency Data:** Tick-by-tick analysis for more precise entropy measurement
2. **Machine Learning:** Neural networks for entropy prediction
3. **Network Analysis:** Cross-market entropy spillovers
4. **Regime Switching:** Time-varying parameters in entropy models

### Known Limitations

1. **Entropy Proxy:** Volatility-based measures may miss other information dimensions
2. **Market Selection:** Focus on major developed markets may miss global effects
3. **Sample Period:** Results may be period-specific
4. **Structural Breaks:** Model assumes stable relationships over time
